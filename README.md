# POLICE SHOOTING IN THE US : FACT VS MYTH

# Introduction
For the MSDS Practicum 1, I wanted to dive deeper into the issue that has been in the news quite frequently and been a concerning topic: police shooting. There was also in incident earlier this year where a military officer was harassed by a policeman. This was a first time I had heard of such incident. In this case, the military officer was a person of a color, which led me to this project and dive deeper into whether people of color are impacted the most by police shooting.
